As of July 2024 I've started a postdoc in Mehrdad Jazayeri's lab at MIT. 

Previously I was a graduate student (neuroscience) in [Robbe Goris'](https://gorislab.github.io/) lab at UT Austin where I studied visual perception and decision making. There I used a combination of perceptual experiments, computational theory, and electrophysiology to uncover the neural basis of uncertainty representation in visual cortex and how sensory population activity gives rise to our metacognitive ability to introspect aboout the quality of perceptual decisons.
